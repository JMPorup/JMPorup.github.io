**_How do we move beyond a world where virtually every computing device and network is insecure?_**

## 70 Theses

1. Imperfect human beings are incapable of creating perfectly-secure computers.

2. Corrupt human beings will create security flaws on purpose in order to gain power over others.

3. Flawed computer security is primarily a political and economic problem, not a technical one.

4. The human race no longer lives "in the real world." We now live online, in the cyber domain.

5. Two columns of power dominate the cyber domain: mass surveillance and targetted hacking.

6. Given a large enough set of people and long enough span of time, power always corrupts.

7. Technology writes constitutional law. (See: Orwell's [_You and the Atom Bomb_](http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/ABomb/english/e_abomb).)

8. Mass surveillance disrupts democracy and redistributes power to the secret police.

9. "Intelligence community" is a euphemism for the secret police. (See: Orwell's [_Politics and the English Language_](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit).)

10. The secret police exist to enforce conformity and suppress dissent.

11. The secret police pose an existential threat to democracy.

12. Hacking disrupts democracy and redistributes power to spies and gangsters (but I repeat myself).

13. Any sufficiently advanced form of protection racket is indistiguishable from government (see: medieval feudalism).

14. "Walled garden" security is a modern form of feudalism.

15. Any sufficiently corrupt intelligence agency is indistiguishable from the mafia.

16. The secret police have seized power in a silent coup.

17. The US Constitution described a balance of power between the people and the state at the time of its drafting.

18. The US Constitution is a technology-specific set of constitutional laws based on the personal firearm and the printing press.

19. The personal firearm and the printing press are obsolete.

20. The US Constitution is obsolete.

21. America today faces a constitutional crisis.

22. The cornerstones of democracy in the cyber domain are unbreakable e2e encryption, anonymity, and end-point security.

23. The cyber domain today is not a democracy.

24. The cyber domain today favors totalitarian dictatorship by the secret police (see thesis 6).

25. Perfect democracy in the cyber domain is not possible (see theses 1 and 2).

26. In the cyber domain, attack is cheap and defense orders of magnitude more expensive.

27. In ancient Athens and 18th century America, democracy arose when offensive military power rested in the hands of ordinary people.

28. Hacking is a form of offensive military power.

29. The more people who know how to use offensive hacking tools, the more the state will fear the people.

30. Tyranny exists when the people fear the state. Liberty exists when the state fears the people. [cite: source needed]

31. Cybersecurity talent is rare and does not scale.

32. Software scales.

33. Both perfect and very imperfect computer security favor democracy.

34. An easily-exploitable cyber domain enables Robin Hood hackers to check the power of the secret police.

35. Governments today seek to create a world of NOBUS security in which the powers to surveil and to hack rest only in the hands of the state.

36. A world of NOBUS security would be a nightmare dystopia of totalitarian dictatorship.

37. Turnkey tyranny will inevitably have its key turned (see thesis 6).

38. Any effort to improve computer security that does not address the secret police as the primary threat is doomed to serve the interests of the secret police.

39. Destroying the power of the secret police and restoring democracy to the cyber domain must be our highest priority.

40. Technical innovation has the power to asymmetrically challenge the power of the secret police.

41. Technical innovation alone is not enough to disrupt the tyrannical powers the secret police have seized for themselves (see thesis 3).

42. The greatest threat to human liberty in the cyber domain is the government of the United States of America.

43. Free market capitalism is a major contributor to rampant computer insecurity.

44. The curse of the "minimally-viable product" is the primary cause of poor IoT security.

45. The "ship it and forget it" business model of most Android OEMs has turned Android users into second-class citizens.

46. The surveillance capitalism practiced by Silicon Valley giants, like Google and Facebook, damages democracy.

47. Surveillance capitalism owns our virtual selves, our "digital doppelgangers."

48. Surveillance capitalism seeks to alter human behaviour at scale using targetted advertisements.

49. With every year that passes our digital doppelgangers grow more complete.

50. To own (or pwn) someone's digital doppelganger is to own them (see thesis 4).

51. Governments around the world will inevitably commandeer tech companies to compel hardware and software backdoors (see thesis 2).

52. The US government has commandeered Silicon Valley.

53. The US government owns everyone subject to Silicon Valley surveillance capitalism.

54. To own a nation's data is to own that nation.

55. Extracting a nation's data is a form of imperial conquest.

56. Some Silicon Valley corporations actively participate in this global data plunder.

57. Facebook's Free Basics is a form of privateering, akin to the British East India Company.

58. Members of the US secret police ("IC") who participate in the military occupation of the cyber domain are gangsters for capitalism (see: Marine Lt. Gen. Smedley Butler).

59. Restoring democracy to the cyber domain requires economic and political tools, not just technical innovation (see thesis 3).

60. The secret police will always be able to exploit cybersecurity flaws.

61. Security nihilism is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

62. Defending against this threat requires us to raise the cost of exploitation.

63. Checking the tyranny of the secret police requires us to hold them accountable for their crimes against democracy, both collectively and individually.

64. Making it easy and safe for whistleblowers to come forward is essential to exposing the crimes of these tyrannical, secretive organizations.

65. Journalists are the last line of defense before the secret police complete their destruction of human freedom on the cyber domain.

66. Naming and shaming individual members of the secret police is essential to holding them accountable for their crimes. (See: [ICWatch](https://icwatch.transparencytoolkit.org/).)

67. Destroying morale in the secret police is an effective way to provoke resignations and leaks.

68. Making it socially unacceptable to work for the secret police is essential to depriving these criminal organizations of skilled engineers.

69. Let the state stand naked before the people, and the people cloaked before the state. Of this democracy consists.

70. Security without freedom is worthless.
