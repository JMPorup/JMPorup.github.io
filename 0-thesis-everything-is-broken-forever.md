imperfect human beings are incapable of creating perfectly-secure computers

<h2 id="html">summary</h2>

Civil engineers who build bridges know that lives are at stake, and design accordingly. Software engineers knows that lives are at stake (or should), but even the best software engineers in the world make mistakes. Flaws make art delightful, but software flaws make the cyber domain a terrifying landscape. The problem will only get worse. Formal methods are cute but won't save us anytime soon--if ever.
