Corrupt human beings will create security flaws on purpose in order to gain power over others.

<h2 id="html">what does this mean?</h2>

Power emanates from the barrel of a gun, Mao said.

A crude statement of the obvious that no longer rings true. The personal firearm is obsolete, replaced by more powerful weapons. Only a fool brings a knife to a gunfight, or a gun to a drone fight.

Meatspace toys like knives and guns are worthless on the cyber domain, where we all now live. Today power emanates from the barrel of security flaws.

Muscle, bronze, steel, gunpowder--all have had their day to shine as weapons of coercion. The eternal struggle of human beings to oppress and enslave each other is no new thing under the sun. This we call politics.

Just as the phalanx or the machine gun or the bulletproof vest possess unique properties that disrupt and redistribute political power, so too do weapons of the cyber domain--weapons far more subtle, but also far more powerful, than Mao could ever have imagined.

A new form of power has arisen, in a new realm, where the world becomes knowledge, knowledge is power, and power corrupts.

Welcome to the cyberz.

Here, security flaws are the keys to the kingdom. Instead of Genghis Khan appearing before the gates of Samarkand, only to destroy that seat of imperial power and kill and enslave its people, today's conquering armies swarm across the electromagnetic spectrum, riding fiber optic cables to plunder and ravage at only a fraction less than the speed of light.

The cyber domain today is a live-fire battlefield where undeclared war is underway, and civilians frequent casualties.

Exploiting human weakness to gain power over others is the punchline to every history book written, and most soap operas. Genuine human error by well-intentioned, skilled engineers creates tiny flaws. But molehills become mountains on the cyber domain, each bump and crack a jagged peak or yawning chasm.

Those who know how to wield these weapons stand astride the earth like a colossus.

Spies do this. Overt police forces. Militaries. Organized criminals engaged in racketeering--what is ransomware but a new form of racket?--even some multinational corporations, although they'd never admit it.

But relying on the incompetence of others to get and keep power is a brittle thing, and therefore dangerous. Far better, reason the power-hungry, to create security flaws on purpose.

Only governments can play this game. A court order, backed by the coercive power of the state, wrapped up in a bow with a gag order, and you have the recipe for totalitarian power such as humanity has never seen.

Politics is the use of coercive force to control other people. We can dress up our Stockholm Syndrome with pretty talk of laws and constitutions, but at bottom politics is about the ruthless capture and keeping of power to command the lives of others.

War, as von Clausewitz noted, is merely an extension of politics by other means.

But security flaws also enable asymmetric warfare on a scale never before possible. A small team can wield big power, and nations the size of Israel and Iran can project political power around the world.

The power that security flaws give their possessors, the impossibility of creating perfectly-secure computers, and the irresistible temptation to create security flaws on purpose--combined, these three facts make computer security the central political question of our times.
