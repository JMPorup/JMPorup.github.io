Nature Abhors a Vacuum, and So Do I!
====================================

### wc: ~900


The presidential candidate thumped the podium. "And that is why," he declared to the packed stadium, "if I am elected president, I will declare war on space!"

He rode the crest of cheers, launched into his favorite talking point:

"Nature abhors a vacuum, and so do I!"

Nathan McDaniels VIII plucked at his polka-dotted suit, and panted for breath. The crowd stomped the floor, chanted, "No more space! Down with space!" The din was delightful.

"My friends," he said, and held up his hands for silence. The crowd hushed. "Billions and billions," he intoned, and the crowd shouted back, "Billions and billions!"

"Yes, my fellow Americans," he cried, "billions and billions. Of stars! Hogging all that mass and distorting the space. Time. Continuum." McDaniels pounded the podium with each word.

The audience growled. He could sense their anger, their frustration, their bitterness. A lone voice down front screeched, "Darn them all to heck!"

"To heck!" McDaniels seized upon the word. "Yes, to heck! The oligarchs of the universe. How dare they? Who the heck do they think they are, anyway?"

"Shame on them!" he roared, face turning red. "We must not accept this unnatural concentration of matter. We must level the playing field for all atoms. Every single atom in the universe!"

When the cheers subsided, McDaniels leaned forward and whispered into the microphone, his words echoing across the stadium, thrilling eighty thousand followers. "For are we," he said in hushed tones, "or are we not, all made up of atoms?"

From the crowd rose cries of "oh, yeah" and "uh-huh" and "you said it, brother."

"Our precious atoms cry out, yearning to be free," he said, so softly the crowd had to strain to hear him. "How can we be free if a universe of atomic and subatomic particles remain enslaved to gravitational forces beyond their control?"

"Gravity!" he said with scorn, voice rising in rage. "Gravity, that brutal, unnatural taskmaster. Driving poor, young hydrogen atoms to an early grave. Consumed in the fiery bowels of some star."

"And for what? For what, I ask you?" McDaniels looked around the stadium as though expecting an answer. "So that greedy stars may burn more brightly."

"Is that fair?" he demanded. "Is that just?"

The screech from below once more: "Darn those stars to heck!"

"And to heck they shall be darned, madam!" McDaniels said. "For we hold in our hands the world's, nay, the universe's, most powerful weapon: Entropy!"

The crowd hummed and buzzed at this news. Not part of his stump speech. The candidate grinned. "Yes, entropy!" he thundered, unsure which law of thermodynamics it was but pretty sure it was one of them. "We have built an entropy weapon. To level the playing field once and for all, and to ensure justice for every atom in the universe!"

McDaniels drank up the adulation, the noise of his people, the love in that domed
bowl. 

"But have no fear, my fellow Americans. Only 'Big Star'"--he made air quotes with his fingers--"need fear entropy."

"What does the weapon do?" McDaniels cocked an eyebrow. "I will show you tonight. Behold!"

On the stadium screen a star burned in blackness. Section by section the stadium lights blinked off, until only that one star burned in the darkened space.

"We point our weapon at a star of our choosing, pull the trigger, and then--"

The star exploded into supernova. The crowd oohed and ahhed.

"That," McDaniels said, pointing to the screen, "was a simulation. Who wants to see this happen in real life? Who wants to bring justice to the universe? Who wants to wipe the smile from the faces of these oligarchs once and for all?"

Cries of outrage, stomping, stomping, stomping, that chant again: "Down with stars! No more stars!" Until eighty thousand voices screamed at him in unison.

McDaniels spoke into the microphone, but no one could hear what he said. He pointed to an assistant, then at the dome above. The roof of the stadium rolled back, revealing a starry sky. The cool early November air flooded in, cooling tempers. The chanting rose up to the stars, and faded.

He held aloft a thin metal tube. The crowd remained standing, hushing each other.

"Darn those stars to heck!" That screech once more.

"To heck we darn them now," McDaniels said solemnly. "Because, right here, my friends, we are about to liberate billions and billions of enslaved atoms across the universe."

He pointed the tube at the sky and cried, "Freedom!"

For a moment, nothing happened. His hand traced zigzags across the sky, spun in circles, made X's across the heavens. The Milky Way stained the darkness with its filthy oligarchy.

With a loud bang, one star exploded into supernova, a red and yellow and green streak painting the night. One after another, to a rising cacaphony of 80s pop music, every star in the sky exploded, entropy releasing tortured atoms from unwanted gravitational forces.

The crowd screamed and wept and cried McDaniels's name. A final rapid-fire series of deafening explosions shattered a few eardrums, and reduced the rest to quivering ecstasy.

"Tomorrow," McDaniels whispered. "Tomorrow is election day. When you go the polls, remember which candidate stands for freedom. Good night!"

Hands over his head, McDaniels accepted the adulation of the crowd. A fine mist of spent gunpowder descended upon the stadium, but no one seemed to notice.
