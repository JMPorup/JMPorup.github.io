J.M. Porup is a cybersecurity &amp;&amp; national security reporter.
</p>
<p>
He has covered wrongdoing at the <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/the-nsas-skynet-program-may-be-killing-thousands-of-innocent-people/">NSA</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/04/uk-secret-police-surveillance-bulk-personal-datasets/">GCHQ</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/technology/security-flaws-cyberweapons-1.3742751">CSE</a>, and <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/european-spy-tech-sold-to-secret-branch-of-egyptian-intelligence-claims-new-report/">elsewhere</a>. His work has appeared in <em>Ars Technica,</em> <em>The Christian Science Monitor,</em> <em>Slate,</em> <em>Motherboard,</em> <em>The Daily Dot,</em> <em>The Kernel,</em> <em>The Economist,</em> <em>CyberScoop,</em> and the CBC. He is currently a full-time senior security reporter on staff at <em>CSO Online.</em> 
</p>
<p>
A programmer and sysadmin turned journalist, Porup holds a Master of Information and Cybersecurity (MICS) from the UC Berkeley iSchool. He lives in New York.
</p>

<p>
He prototyped new security tools as part of the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/node/99717">Berkman Klein Assembly 2017</a> security incubator at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University. While at Berkeley he also worked as a public interest technologist defending an international NGO with nation-state adversaries as part of the CLTC's <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/about-us/citizen-clinic/">Citizen Clinic.</a>
</p>

<p>
In a former life, he worked for many years as a F/LOSS programmer in Melbourne, Australia. As a reporter with a solid background in computer science, he brings a depth of technical understanding to his reporting that few journalists possess.
</p>

<p>
He reported from Latin America for a long time. From his base in Cali, Colombia, he co-authored Lonely Planet guidebooks to Venezuela, the Dominican Republic &amp; Haiti, South America on a Shoestring, and the Caribbean Islands. He was the Co-ordinating Author of <em>Lonely Planet Colombia, 5th ed.</em> He speaks Spanish fluently with a hilarious gringo-Colombian accent.
</p>

<p>
Porup is also a novelist, playwright, and satirist, and plays the ukulele (badly).
