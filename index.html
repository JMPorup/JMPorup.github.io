<a id="jm-porup" class="anchor" href="#jm-porup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>J.M. Porup</h3>

<p>J.M. Porup is an American journalist covering the intersection of technology and politics.</p>

<p>He worked for many years as a Perl hacker in Melbourne, Australia. A backpacking trip to South America turned into a five-guidebook gig with Lonely Planet. He's spent most of the last decade living in and reporting from Latin America, including four years based in Cali, Colombia. Claro que hablo castellano.</p>

<a id="journalist" class="anchor" href="#journalist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Journalist</h3>

<p>I freelance mostly for Vice Motherboard. (Read my most recent article <a href="motherboard.vice.com/author/jmporup">here</a>.) I've also written for The Economist. My first editor, way back in the mid-90s, called me a "loose cannon." He meant it as a compliment. I think.</p>

<p>As a ex-hacker, I specialize in covering technical subjects other journalists don't grok. Technology disrupts the social-political order and redistributes power. Surveillance, hacking, privacy/security tech--this is my beat.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hacker" class="anchor" href="#hacker" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hacker</h3>

<p>What is a hacker? Probably not what you think (link). Mostly I built bespoke software for Australasian client. (This was before the whole startup scene went global.) I've been a Linux user since 2002 and a PGP user since 2005. I'm but a stranger here, Debian is my home.</p>

<h3>
<a id="cypherpunk" class="anchor" href="#cypherpunk" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cypherpunk</h3>

<p>Punk is an attitude. Resistance to coercion. From the state, from society. Cypherpunks resist by using encryption. I do not ask for my privacy. I will take it, with or without your permission. "IRL" is dead. We now live on the Internet. New game, new rules. </p>

<h3>
<a id="travel-writer" class="anchor" href="#travel-writer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Travel Writer</h3>

<p>I wrote five guidebooks for Lonely Planet: Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic &amp; Haiti, Caribbean Islands, and South America on a Shoestring. I was the Co-ordinating Author of Lonely Planet Colombia (5th ed.), widely considered the best guidebook to Colombia at the time.</p>

<p>I've chilled in jungle bivouacs with Colombian marines with their fingers on their triggers. I researched the Venezuela guidebook during a Chavez re-election. Travel writing ain't all beaches and umbrella cocktails.</p>

<h3>
<a id="novelist" class="anchor" href="#novelist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Novelist</h3>

<p>Mostly science fiction. Some noir. I'm especially proud of The United States of Air, my 2012 political satire that mocks NSA surveillance.</p>

<h3>
<a id="futurist" class="anchor" href="#futurist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Futurist</h3>

<p>So a couple of years ago the Lifeboat Foundation asked me to join their Advisory Board. Lifeboat is a distributed think tank dedicated to preventing a negative singularity. Scientists, engineers, journalists, and science fiction writers wrangle over the latest existential threats to humanity. It's a blast.</p>
