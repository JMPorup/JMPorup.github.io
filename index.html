<p>J.M. Porup is a freelance cybersecurity reporter. His work has appeared in <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/author/jmporup/">Motherboard</a> and The Economist, and has sold stories to Slate and the Toronto Star (coming soon). He specializes in covering the IoT space.
</p>
<p>Porup began studying infosec in 2002. A programmer for many years, he learned the ropes from senior sysadmins who believed security comes first. 
</p>
<p>We now live on the Internet. The rules are different here. The power balance is different. All of the attacks we've seen over the last fifteen years are on the brink of jumping into the real world. Too few journalists and policymakers understand the consequences. That's a problem.
</p>
<p>Porup spent several years writing Lonely Planet travel guidebooks to Latin America, and is best known for his work as the head writer of Lonely Planet Colombia 5th ed. He is also a novelist and satirist critical of the surveillance state.
