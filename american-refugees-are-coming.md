"We are facing a refugee crisis!" the Merkan Bassador thundered. "Thousands of them, streaming across our border into Canada. These people are terrorists, all of them!"

The Mishy-Mish stroked his bald head. "The Really Crummy Maple-Flavored Police are on it, sir."

"The RCMP this, the RCMP that," the Bassador mocked. "That's not good enough! Don't you understand? These terrorists are bringing their extremist ideology of democracy and freedom of speech to Canada!"

"Well, sir," the Mishy-Mish chuckled, and lifted the oaken cask he wore around his neck like a St. Bernard, and drank from the spigot, "if they come here thinking there's freedom of speech in Canada, we will be sure to show them their mistake."

The Bassador took off his hundred-gallon cowboy hat and wiped his forehead. "Whoo-eee!" he laughed. "Freedom of speech! In Canada! I knew I could count on you, Mishy-Mash."

"Mishy-*Mish,*" the Mishy-Mish corrected. "Let me show you how we're handling these American refugee terrorists. Here's one now."

He tapped at his laptop, spun the screen to show the dossier of a grey-haired woman smiling at the camera.

"My God!" the Bassador said. "Just look at her! Those crazed eyes! The wild expression! Who is she, do we know?"

"Known terrorist, I'm afraid," Mishy-Mish said gravely. He adjusted his armpit-high brown jackboots under his ankle-length red coat. "Just listen to this recording."

A scratchy connection, then a male voice said, "But I don't understand. Why did you move to Canada? Is America not good enough for you or something?"

"I'm really sorry," a woman's voice said. "I don't want my kids to grow up under Trump."

The Bassador whooped. "Holy shit, you found one! Should we drone her?"

The Mishy-Mish frowned. "A drone strike on Canadian soil would awaken the people to our benevolent...control of society."

"Gotcha. Gotta babysit these people, don't know what's good for 'em." Bassador stroked the invisible lapels of his invisible suit. "Need to take her out in a plausa-boobly deniable way. Them's the words?"

"Plausibly deniable, yes, sir, but I don't think--"

"Get SEAL Team 6 take her out. Boom. Car accident. Heart attack. Or maybe cancer. What do you say?"

The Mishy-Mish drank deep from his oaken cask once more. "No," he said at last, "we can't kill them all."

"Well why the hell not? Worked well enough in Pakistan."

Mishy-Mish patted the Bassador's invisibly-gloved hand, averted his gaze from the man's invisible underwear. "In due time. I've got a better idea."

"Lay it on me, Mashy-Mish."

The head of the RCMP considered for a moment. "I propose," he said, "to lock them all up in an open-air prison."

Bassador threw his hundred-gallon hat into the air. "Is it a private prison?" he asked excitedly. "I own stock in a bunch of them companies."

The Mishy-Mish looked over his yard-wide reading glasses at the Bassador. "You own stock in Google or Facebook or Apple or Microsoft?"

"Sure do!"

"Then you're good. We're tracking her everywhere she goes, we've live-miked her phone, her tablet, her laptop, plus video recording from all those webcams. Plus her car, her home IoT. We know who she talks to, what she says, what she eats, where she sleeps, who she sleeps with, and what she whispers on the potty when she passes a tough turd." Mishy-Mish leaned across the desk that stood between them. "One hint she's planning to blow something up? We'll swoop in and arrest her."

So saying, Mishy-Mish sat back and took a long drink from his oaken cask.

Bassador made a face. "How can you drink that maple-flavored garbage?"

Mishy-Mish wiped the artificially-flavored syrup from his lips. "Budget cuts. What can you do?"

"Because it's not bombs we're worried about," the Bassador said, locking his hands behind his invisible trousers. "It's their tweets!"

"Tweets?"

"Worse than bombs, I tell you. Scary as hell!"

"Ah, you mean that Twitter thing all the cool terrorists are using these days."

"What are we going to do about this menace?" the Bassador asked, throwing out his arms in frustration. "Tweeting from safety from their terrorist hideout in--Canada!"

The Mishy-Mish made a rude noise, or would have, if he wasn't Canadian. "Pshaw."

"Pshaw?"

"I said pshaw and I mean pshaw! We've got Peace Bonds up here. Anyone gets out of line, we don't like their freedom of speech?" Mishy-Mish adjusted his four-foot wide hat. "We just blackmail a judge to make the terrorist shut up."

"Or else?"

"Or else they go to jail! I mean, come on, this is Canada. A free country."

Both men burst out laughing till tears ran down their faces.

"But wait," Bassador said, wiping his eyes on his invisible sleeve. "What about you-know-who?"

"What about him?"

"Well...what if he objects? Isn't he all, 'we support refugee, we love terrorists'?" Bassador pounded the desk. "Who the hell does he think he is, anyway? Acts like he's the boss around here or something."

"He *is* the prime minister of Canada," Mishy-Mish pointed out.

"The PM reports to me, and I report to the president. Sheesh! This is basic chain of command. Did Daddy never teach him?"

Mishy-Mish made a face. "Apparently not. Shall I page him for you?"

"Is he in town?"

"Parliament's in session today." Mishy-Mish pulled a small black box from a pocket and pushed a large red button.

"Will he be long?" the Bassador asked.

"I shouldn't think so. May I offer you some refreshment?"

The Merkan eyed the spigot but waved it away. "Budget cuts, shit." He settled himself into the chair and propped his invisibly-shod feet onto the desk.

Outside, shoes clattered against the hallway floor, skidded and turned, and a man burst into the room. Not just any man, though. *The* man. The Canadian Man.

"How long till the missiles reach us?" he panted.

"Relax," Mishy-Mish said. "There's no nuclear attack underway. I just needed your attention for a moment."

The Canadian Man pointed a finger at Mishy-Mish's head. "You're fired." He turned to Bassador. "And you! What are you doing in my office? That's my chair! And why," he asked, "are you naked?"

The Bassador flushed. "If you'll look closely, you'll see that this is the latest in nano-tech fashion-tech high-tech tech-tech from Silicon Valley."

The Canadian Man swept the Bassador's feet from the desk. "Get out. Now. Both of you."

Neither moved.

"Didn't you hear what I just said?"

Bassador studied his fingernails, and sang, "Chain of comm-a-and..."

"Temper, temper, now." Mishy-Mish held up a hand. "We just want to talk to you about," and he lowered his voice, "the refugee crisis."

The Canadian Man ripped open his shirt, buttons popping, to reveal a tattoo of a lumberjack that stretched from navel to nipples. "I welcome refugees to Canada."

"But these are *American* refugees!" Bassador said.

"If they come fleeing political oppression, then they are welcome here in Canada." The Canadian Man straightened his shirt, adjusted his tie. "Now, if there's nothing else, I have to go elbow some boobies."

"Have you seen their terrorist scores?" Mishy-Mish asked. "Their terroristiness is off the charts!"

"Didn't a couple of journalists prove that terroristiness scores are completely bullshit?" the PM said.

Bassador snapped his fingers. "Yeah, Grothoff and Porup."

"Porup," the PM said. "You mean the author of the satire we're in right now?"

"That's the one. Wait till you see the *their* terroristiness scores. Porup especially."

"Journalists are terorrists!" the Bassador shouted. "Even worse than these goddam refugees!"

"Enough!" Canadian Man roared. "We're done here. Understood?"

"No," Bassador growled, and stood up. The other men looked away. "Your Daddy knew how to take orders from the boss."

The PM rolled his eyes. "You mean Mom?"

Bassador jerked his thumb at Mishy-Mish. "Can you get a load of this guy?"

Mishy-Mish fingered the top of his jackboots. "Your predecessor, of the other party, he understood the chain of command well enough. Consider this an...intervention. For your own good."

Canadian Man snorted. "You got nothing you can blackmail me with. Every stupid thing I've ever done is on YouTube."

"What about your caucus?" Bassador asked.

"What about them? I've got a mandate!"

"And I've got NSA watching every last one of them." Bassador strolled around from behind the desk. "Their family. Friends. Staff. I've got blackmail on them all. What did you think mass surveillance was for?"

Canadian Man lowered his chin. "You. Wouldn't. Dare."

The Merkan patted the PM's cheek. "I'm not Canadian. I'm American. And I'm not sorry."

"But, CSE--"

Bassador laughed. "Are going to what? Protect you? They work for us. Always have."

Canadian Man turned to Mishy-Mish. "But this is a threat to Canadian sovereignity. What are you going to do about this?"

Mishy-Mish sipped at his maple-flavored syrup. "Help them blackmail your caucus? Do their legwork here on the ground?" He tugged at his floor-length red jacket. "After all, we are the Really Crummy Maple-Flavored Police."

"But...But...But..." The PM stared around the room.

"Oh no," Mishy-Mish said. He rummaged around in a pocket, held out an open palm to Bassador.

"Earplugs?"

"Put them in. Do it."

Just in time, too. The PM fell to the ground, kicking and beating the floor, and screaming at the top of his lungs, " I want my mommy! I want my mommy! I want my mommy!"

"Doesn't he mean, 'I want my daddy'?" Bassador asked.

"Good point," the PM said, and began screaming with renewed vigor, "I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy!"

Mishy-Mish jerked his chin at the guard at the door. "Escort the PM back to his office."

"But, sir--"

"Don't question me, constable. Do it!"

"Yes, sir!"

The guard did not move.

Mishy-Mish rose, quivering with rage. "Did I, or did I not, order you to escort the PM back to his office?"

"Sir! This is the PM's office, sir!"

"Then take him back to wherever he came from!"

The constable scooped up the flailing PM, hoisted him over one shoulder. "Back to his mother's womb, yes, sir!"

The door closed. The wailing faded into the distance. Bassador picked at his nano-tech thong. Mishy-Mish sucked from his oaken cask.

"He's on board now?" the Merkan asked. "Last thing we need's a loose cannon politician mouthing off."

Mishy-Mish patted the man's invisibly-clad knee. "Canada's your first and best colonial possession," he said. "Don't you ever doubt it."

The Merkan chuckled. "Canada: American's best bitch. I like the sound of that." Then his expression grew serious. "Goddamn terrorists. What's the world coming to when you can't oppress your own people without them turning into Twitter terrorists?"

"The Really Crummy Maple-Flavored Police are on it, sir," the Mishy-Mish said. "We won't let these American refugees hurt your feels with their word-bombs, not on my watch."

Bassador sat down on the edge of the desk. "That's what I love about you Mashy-Mash," he said. "You know where your true loyalties lie."

"Always, sir. And it's Mishy-Mish."
